## Usage
* To ensure webpage meets accessibility standards:
   * Look at the source code and ensure it contains semantic HTML with elements that help developers and browsers understand what it does and how the content is structured. 
   * Look at the structure of the HTML elements and find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. This will help the screen reader navigate through the webpage.
   * Examples:
        * Look at the image elements and ensure it contains accessible alt attributes.
        * Look at the heading attributes and ensure they fall in sequential order.
        * Look at the title elements and find a concise, descriptive title
